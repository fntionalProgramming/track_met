NOTES:

1. There wil SOME be unknown values for people who are registered in Relay events, 
in the rolling_schedule.csv and the unknown value
only appear because of the ambiguity in the Trackie website, IT IS NOT MY FAULT

2. I am not sure about the consistency of the data format in both the trackie
and especially sssad website so if there is anything broken, just send me a github issue
